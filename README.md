# VBA-challenge

Had trouble running my code after saving
Each time I saved and opened again one peice of unchanged code stopped working.

I got each peice to work before breaking down except the percent change never gave me the correct number, I belive that's from not being able to save the first value of each iteration.

Currently it won't do a calculation past a certain number, although if I change the formula to something wrong, it'll run proper
The color formating is running backwards now too.
It also stopped going through all the worksheets even though when I go step by step I watch it go through

Attempted the Xpert learning, but it couldn't figure out why the code wouldn't work

*also had a little trouble with github file sizes (after realizing I shouldn't have put the resources in there) tahts why i only have the one commit
